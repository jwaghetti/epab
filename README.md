# EPAB - EPAB Prepares A Backup 

For the files in a directory and its subdirectories,
compress them and generate the md5sum.

If there are files already compressed, md5sum is
verified.

Compression is through lzma and each file is
compressed separately.

### Setup

Copy the files that will be processed by EPAB
then run it. More files can be added to the
directory after EPAB, just run the command
again and the new files will be compressed and
md5sum created.
